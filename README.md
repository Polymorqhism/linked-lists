# Linked Lists

## Limitations:
please keep in mind that singly linked list functionality is at a minimum as of current and does not provide functions to manage the list

## Functionality:
- create nodes `create_node()`
- modify node data `modify_node_data()`
- link two nodes accordingly `link_nodes()`
- delete the whole linked list `delete_list()`
- get a node by its index in the list `get_node_number()`
- delete a single node `delete_node()`
- get the node type (enum) `HEAD`, `MIDDLE`, `TAIL` with `get_node_type()`
